# Biomarker discovery and Drug target identification in Candida glabrata

Candida glabrata is an opportunistic yeast that poses a growing threat in immunocompromised patients, particularly due to its increasing resistance to common antifungal agents. Identifying unique biomarkers and effective drug targets is critical for developing new therapeutic strategies.

This project outlines a comprehensive methodology for discovering biomarkers and identifying drug targets in Candida glabrata, a significant fungal pathogen known for its resistance to antifungal therapies. The integration of computational tools such as genome-scale metabolic models, BLASTp, molecular docking, AlphaFold, DALI will be detailed.

# **Methods**

## **Genome-Scale Metabolic Model (GEMM)**
Model Development: The GEMM for Candida glabrata is constructed using publicly available genomic and transcriptomic data. Tools such as the COBRA Toolbox facilitate the reconstruction of the metabolic network, allowing for the exploration of metabolic pathways critical to pathogenicity and drug resistance.

 Pathway Analysis: Analyze metabolic pathways to identify key processes contributing to virulence and potential biomarkers.

##  **Identification of Unique Proteins using BLASTp**
Proteome Comparison:
Use BLASTp to compare the Candida glabrata proteome against human proteins and other Candida species (e.g., Candida albicans).
Prepare a comprehensive database including human and various Candida proteomes for comparison.
Set appropriate BLASTp parameters (e.g., e-value threshold, scoring matrix) to identify unique proteins.
Candidate Biomarkers: Filter results to select proteins unique to Candida glabrata without homologs in humans, reducing the risk of off-target effects.

## **Structure Prediction using AlphaFold**
AlphaFold Implementation:
Utilize AlphaFold to predict the 3D structures of the unique proteins identified through BLASTp.
Prepare the protein sequences as input for AlphaFold, ensuring data quality and appropriate formatting.
Quality Assessment: Evaluate the structural predictions using confidence metrics provided by AlphaFold, ensuring reliability in downstream analyses.

## **Structure-Based Searches using DALI**
DALI Search:
Submit predicted protein structures to the DALI server to identify structurally similar proteins with known functions.
Interpret the results to uncover potential functional insights and conserved mechanisms that could inform target selection.

## **Molecular Docking**
Docking Setup:
Conduct molecular docking studies to evaluate interactions between the unique proteins and potential small molecule inhibitors.
Use software such as AutoDock Vina, setting parameters for binding site identification and docking simulations.
Analysis of Results: Report docking scores and binding affinities, highlighting key interactions and the potential for specificity against Candida glabrata targets.

## **Inhibitor Design**
Design Strategy:
Implement structure-based drug design approaches to develop inhibitors targeting unique proteins.
Conduct virtual screening of compound libraries to identify promising candidates.
Lead Optimization: Optimize identified leads through iterative design processes, assessing binding affinity and pharmacokinetic properties to enhance therapeutic potential.
