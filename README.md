# Biomarker discovery and Drug target identification in Candida glabrata

Candida glabrata is an opportunistic yeast that poses a growing threat in immunocompromised patients, particularly due to its increasing resistance to common antifungal agents. Identifying unique biomarkers and effective drug targets is critical for developing new therapeutic strategies.

This project outlines a comprehensive methodology for discovering biomarkers and identifying drug targets in Candida glabrata, a significant fungal pathogen known for its resistance to antifungal therapies. The integration of computational tools such as genome-scale metabolic models, BLASTp, molecular docking, AlphaFold, DALI will be detailed.

# **Methods**

## **Genome-Scale Metabolic Model (GEMM)**
The GEMM for Candida glabrata is constructed using publicly available genomic and transcriptomic data. The metabolic network reconstruction is facilitated by tools such as the COBRA Toolbox, allowing for the exploration of metabolic pathways critical to pathogenicity and drug resistance.

 Pathway Analysis: Metabolic pathways are analyzed to identify key processes contributing to virulence and potential biomarkers.

##  **Identification of Unique Proteins using BLASTp**
Proteome Comparison:
BLASTp is used to compare the Candida glabrata proteome against human proteins and those of other Candida species (e.g., Candida albicans). A comprehensive database, including human and various Candida proteomes, is prepared for comparison. BLASTp parameters (e.g., e-value threshold, scoring matrix) are set appropriately to identify unique proteins.
Candidate Biomarkers: The results are filtered to select proteins unique to Candida glabrata without homologs in humans, reducing the risk of off-target effects.

## **Structure Prediction using AlphaFold**
AlphaFold Implementation:
AlphaFold is utilized to predict the 3D structures of the unique proteins identified through BLASTp. The protein sequences are prepared as input for AlphaFold.

## **Structure-Based Searches using DALI**
DALI Search:
Predicted protein structures are submitted to the DALI server to identify structurally similar proteins with known functions. The results are interpreted to uncover potential functional insights and conserved mechanisms that could inform target selection.

## **Molecular Docking**
Docking Setup:
Molecular docking studies are conducted to evaluate interactions between the unique proteins and potential small molecule inhibitors. Software such as AutoDock Vina is used, with parameters set for binding site identification and docking simulations.

#  Results
Unique Protein Candidates: A list of unique proteins identified from BLASTp analysis is provided, highlighting those with potential biomarker roles.
Predicted Structures: A summary of AlphaFold predictions is included, featuring structures with high confidence scores.
DALI Findings: Insights gained from DALI searches are presented, including functional annotations of homologous proteins.
Docking Results: Docking scores are reported, highlighting interactions for selected inhibitors.

## Discussion
Interpretation of Findings: Analyze the implications of identified biomarkers and drug targets, discussing how they may contribute to improved treatment strategies for Candida glabrata infections.
Comparison with Existing Therapies: Evaluate how new targets and biomarkers compare to current antifungal treatments, addressing potential advantages.
Limitations: Acknowledge any methodological limitations and suggest future research directions to enhance the study.
